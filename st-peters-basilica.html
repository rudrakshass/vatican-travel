            <p>St. Peter’s Basilica, one of the largest and most important churches in Christianity, is located in Vatican City. Built over what is believed to be the burial site of Saint Peter, one of the twelve apostles of Jesus, it’s an architectural marvel designed by renowned artists like Michelangelo and Bernini. The basilica’s vast interior, dome, and famous artwork, such as Michelangelo's "Pietà," attract millions of visitors yearly.
