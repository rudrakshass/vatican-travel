        <p>Castel Gandolfo is a papal palace located in the town of Castel Gandolfo, about 25 km southeast of Rome. Traditionally used as a summer residence and retreat by the popes, it offers scenic views of Lake Albano. In recent years, some parts of the palace have been opened to the public as a museum, showcasing papal apartments, gardens, and historical artifacts.</p>
